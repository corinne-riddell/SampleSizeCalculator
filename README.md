# Sample Size Calculator for Repeated Measurements Analysis with Continuous Outcomes

This repo contains the R Code for an R Shiny web application that calculates sample size for repeated measurements analysis (i.e., panel studies) when the response variable is a continuous measure. 

It accompanies a forthcoming paper in *Epidemiology* written by Scott Weichenthal, Jill Baumgartner, and James Hanley of the McGill Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health. 

We welcome any contributions you might have! Specifically, it as my first time using observe() in Shiny and I know I'm not using it efficiently... this section of code could definitely benefit from a Shiny developer's eye! Also, I used MathJax to get the formulas to show up but then had trouble later with rendering brackets around prose. I definitely need a better way of writing text and formulas that avoids this issue.

Also note that I'm still in the process of adding the final two graphics (for the variance parameters) so hold tight to see those changes. 

Thank you for stopping by! May your sample sizes be small and your estimates precise,

Corinne
